# Overview

The Water-to-Cloud approach involves collecting water quality data at high geospatial resolution using automated, real-time, non-stationary, state-of-the-art cyberphysical sensor networks.These sensors can collect GPS-tagged and time/date-stamped data every few seconds on various water quality parameters. In case of large water bodies such as rivers, they are deployed on a boatwhich navigates a pre-defined route in the waterbody and collect hundreds of data points over space and time. In case of smaller non-navigable channels such as drains, they are dipped at pre-defined sampling locations to collect pointdata in real time. This high-resolution data is superimposed on geospatial maps using a color- coded scale to form visualizations which are easy to interpret and assess various aspects of river water health. In particular, they can be used to pinpoint pollution sources, analyze temporal and spatial variations in contaminant levels and identify trends in water quality.
