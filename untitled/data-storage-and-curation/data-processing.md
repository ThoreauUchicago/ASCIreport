# Data Processing

Data needs to be cleaned up before creating visualizations from it. A Matlab code reads the data into data frames to find the maximum and minimum value for each parameter. The datais cleaned by removing any undefined values, empty cells and empty rows from the frames. Noise in the data is reduced by using a moving average filter of five. This smoothens the data. For better resolution of images, MATLABâ€™s image processing toolbox is used. The interpolation is done on a mesh grid generating heat-map imagefor any specific parameter. For non-water areas, mesh cell values are made to be Not-a-Number \(NaN\) resulting in processing of only water areas. A base-map is plotted using OpenStreet map API from MapBox similar to google maps and thegeographical coordinates available in the data file.The data range is scaled with the color-bar of the heat-map. Scatter and Interp functions are used to plot the boat route and to plot the interpolated 2-D heatmap. The interpolated image is overlaid on the base map. This creates a heat map that represents spatial and temporal variation of a selected water quality parameter across the river.
