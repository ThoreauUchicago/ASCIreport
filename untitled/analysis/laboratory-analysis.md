# Laboratory Analysis

Sensor-based parameters are validated through laboratory measurements. Furthermore, no reliable sensors are available for a number of organic and inorganic parameters, including heavy metals. Hence, lab analysis provides additional layers of data to supplement the sensor data for any site. Grab samples are taken at the same location and at the same time as that of sensor readings. The lab results of this measurement are then compared with the corresponding sensor readings. This is to ensure that the calibrated sensors are working properly and the sensors values are within a reasonable range of the lab values. Samples are collected by following CPCB guidelines $$^{13}$$
