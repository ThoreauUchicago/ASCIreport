# Statistical Analysis

While heatmaps are good to visualize variations in parameters over a given area on a certain day, statistical averages such as mean, median, mode and standard deviations may be used to understand the macro picture. In order to look at data from a particular site over different seasons or to compare water quality at two different sites, number of basic statistical tools were applied on the data gathered using sensors or lab sampling to provide powerful insights. Box plots, time series analysis and scatter plots have been used in later sections to bring out insights from the data. A description of these tools is given in appendix VII.
