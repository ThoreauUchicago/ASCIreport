# Parameter Selection

Central Pollution Control Board has divided the major pollutants in six categories6:

1. General pollutants including color, odor, temperature, pH, electrical conductivity \(EC\), dissolved oxygen \(DO\), turbidity and total dissolved solid \(TDS\)
2. Nutrients: nitrogenous compounds and phosphate
3. Demand Parameters: Bio-chemical Oxygen demand and Chemical oxygen demand
4. Inorganic ions including heavy metals
5. Other location specific parameters: Arsenic, Fuloride
6. Microbiological parameters: Total coliform and fecal coliform 

Out of all these categories of pollutants, general water quality parameters, demand parameters and microbiological parameters are often used to assess the overall health of the river system. Other parameters are used based on locationsto assess specific pollutant. Details about eachof these parameters and their impact on human and aquatic life are provided in appendix V. A combination of sensor and laboratory-based testing methods are employed to monitor parameters of interest. The table below outlines the various parameters we measure, their common sources and whether they are measured in a lab or through sensors
