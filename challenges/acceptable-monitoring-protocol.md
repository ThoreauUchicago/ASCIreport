# Acceptable Monitoring Protocol

The non-stationary automated sensor-based approach is fairly recent. While CPCB has a robust protocol in place for manual sampling and laboratory testing, no government protocol exists for non-stationary sensor-based monitoring in a standardized manner.

Adoption of a generic monitoring protocol irrespective of the technique will make it easier tocrowd source data from different agencies usingdiverse methods of monitoring. Our on-ground learnings indicate that such a protocol should account for the following from the perspective of sensor-based monitoring:

* **Site Classification**: Classify sites based on a baseline study of pollution levels and known sources in any area.  
  **Class 1:** Critical sites suspected to have multiple pollution hotspots due to continuous wastewater inflow from domestic or industrial draininlets.

  **Class 2:** Sites which are relatively less affectedby point sources of pollution.  
  **Class 3:** Need based assessment sites.

* **Frequency**: Class 1 sites should be prioritized for once a week mobile sensor-based monitoring. This can assist the authorities in charting out a spatial map of pollution hotspots in the water body. This can be supplemented with lab tests. To understand the trend of incoming waste water pollution and take regulatory action to curb pollution where necessary, they need to be monitored at random times of the day. Class 2 sites should be monitored at least twice a month in the morning and evening. Seasonal variation and any sudden variations are important to be noted at these sites. Class 3 sites may have to be monitored multiple times based on the water management issue to be addressed.
* **Source Apportionment:** Upon identifying waste water discharge points, it is important to monitor pollution trends in drains to identify the exact source of any waste. This would provide evidence to authorities to initiate regulatory action. This information can be used to apply the principles of Extended Producer Responsibility \(EPR\) to such entities for them to be accountable for their own waste water.
* **Decentralization:** While it is important to set a minimum frequency of monitoring for each site by CPCB, the decision to add new sites and increase the frequency of testing should be with the state pollution control boards to let them decide if a particular stretch may need to be monitored with higher resolution for a few weeks due to specific events or increased pollution temporarily. This flexibility ensures that critical information is collected while minimizing effort and expenditure by resource mobilization.
* **Interoperability:** A validation process should be put in place for comparison and correlation between sensor data and lab data collected at the same point and time with acceptable limits defined by the government. Each sensor manufacturer may need to procure a validation certificate once it is tested to meet these standards.
* **Local Conditions:** Sites near coastal areas may have waters highly affected by tides in the adjoining seas. For such rivers, precaution should be taken to ensure that monitoring happens during low tides to eliminate any backwater effect. Excessive growth of water hyacinths or algal bloom may restrict movement of boat and such areas should be avoided.
* **Metadata:** Information on rainfall, solar irradiance, GPS location, exact time of data collection, data on industrial, agricultural and domestic sources of pollution and the gaps between waste water generated and treated, etc. should be noted and available with the water quality data to increase trustworthiness of such data.
* **Navigation:** It should be ensured that depth of water at the monitoring sites is at least 3 feet to allow navigability of boat and to avoid damage to sensors due to contact with the river bed. Sensor probes should be fixed at a depth of at least 1 feet below the surface of water for accurate measurements. For surface measurements, a depth of 1-3 feet is recommended.
* **Capacity Building:** Field staff should be trained once every six months to ensure retention of knowledge on data collection and testing practices to be followed.
