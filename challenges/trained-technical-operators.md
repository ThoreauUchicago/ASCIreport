# Trained Technical Operators

Diligent field staff who are careful in handlingsensor equipment must be employed for smooth operations. They must be trained in sensor calibration, maintenance and usage. They must attach sensors properly to the rod before fixing it to the boat. Although sensors are automated, it is advisable for field operators to monitorits readings through the hand held meters or evaluate readings on the laptop to check if all probes are functional and the data is as expected based on observed water conditions on that day. They should be capable of troubleshooting any issue by themselves or through an expert to mitigate any sensor malfunctioning or damage. Availability of such human resources is limited in India today and this could be a bottleneck for scaling.
