# Ground Situation Analysis

Actionability of data may be limited if water quality data is analyzed in isolation. Metadata on amount of sunlight, rainfall, increased anthropogenic activities on a given day due to a special occasion, unusually active or inactive drains, opening or closing of barrage gates, etc. requires notes from field observations. This information enriches the data collected for better interpretation. However, such data may not be accessible to the public through various government portals or shared internally between departments for ease of analysis.
