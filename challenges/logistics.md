Boat-based measurements are dependent on availability and navigability of boats. Bad weather due to heavy rains or waters with algal bloom may restrict movement of boats. In fact, a boat may not even be available in some areas. Moving to remote-controlled \(RC\) float boats to carry sensors or unmanned automatic vehicles \(UAV\) may reduce reliance on these external factors but such vehicles may not be portable which is the USP of this technique.
