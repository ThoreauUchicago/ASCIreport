# Sensor Technology

There are no available commercial sensors for crucial organic parameters such as BOD, COD, total coliform, etc. which may provide accurate values in real time. These are crucial indicators for safe drinking and bathing water and measuring them in labs is time-intensive. Proxy parameters are monitored using sensors such as the Turners C3 and Photonic measurements UV254! but they are expensive and their readings may be affected by turbidity. Thus, sensing technology may need a few more years before this approach can become truly cost-effective.
