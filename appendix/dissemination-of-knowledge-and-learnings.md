# Appendix I: Dissemination of Knowledge and Learnings

The Water-to-Cloud team has published and presented its work at various platforms in India and internationally. We have been invited to several talks to present our work on river water quality monitoring and the Water-to-Cloud system. The team also hosted and participated in multiple workshops and panel discussions. All such publications, talks, presentation, workshops and publications have been listed.
