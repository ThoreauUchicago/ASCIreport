# Appendix III: Team Profile

**Professor Supratik Guha \| Principal Investigator**  
Dr Guha is the Professor at the Pritzker School for Molecular Engineering \(PME\), The University of Chicago; Director of the Nanoscience and Technology Division and the Center for Nanoscale Materials at the Argonne National Laboratory. He joined Argonne in 2015 after spending 20 years at IBM Research where he last served as the Director of Physical Sciences. At IBM, Dr. Guha pioneered the materials research that led to IBM’s high dielectric constant metal gate transistor, one of the mostsignificant developments in silicon microelectronics technology, and used in over 50% of smart phones in use today. He was also responsible for initiating or significantly expanding IBM’s R&D programs incyberphysical systems and sensor networks.

Dr. Guha is a member of the U.S. National Academy of Engineering and a Fellow of the Materials Research Society, American Physical Society and the recipient of the 2015 Prize for Industrial Applications of Physics. He received his Ph.D. in materials science in 1991 from the University of S. California, and a B.Tech in 1985 from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur. His research interests are focused on sensing, cyberphysical systems and future information processing.

**Priyank Hirani \| Program Director**  
Priyank Hirani received his MS in Integrated Circuit Design from Imperial College London in 2013. After graduation, he worked for Mullard Space Science Lab in UK before returning to India in2015. Through various research endeavors, he has been exposed to the fields of water & sanitation,agriculture, energy, wireless communication, biotechnology and space science. He hopes to use this diverse experience in attempting to solve real world issues now. Priyank pursued the Young India Fellowship in 2015 and enhanced his understanding of contemporary India, its heritage, its problems and its international relations.

Having worked with the Andhra Pradesh government on sanitation issues in 2016-17, he has developed an understanding of the nuances of grassroots implementation of large-scale public projects. Priyank leads the operations for the project, coordinating between the science and engineering team in India and the US.

**Himank Sharma \| Project Lead**  
Himank graduated in Liberal Studies from the Young India Fellowship at Ashoka University in 2016. Prior to that he majored in Electronics and Electrical Communication engineering and worked as a Network Consulting Engineer with Cisco for a couple of years. Since 2016, Himank has been working with TechnoServe in the international development space to devise business solutions for poverty. He worked at the grassroots in India, Ghana and Kenya with a focus on improving livelihood opportunities for farmers through business and technology. Continuing his streak of solving real world problems, he is now working with Water-to-Cloud to explore practical applications of Thoreau technology to solve the challenge of sanitation in India.

Himank takes care of managing the team and operations.

**Dr Srinivasa Rao Balivada \| Water Research Lead**  
Dr Srinivasa Rao Balivada holds a Ph.D in Chemistry from Andhra University, Visakhapatnam. Prior to joining this project, he was a research fellow at Centre for Studies on Bay of Bengal at Andhra University. He has also worked on Ministry of Earth Science projects on impact of oceanographicparameters on fishery resources. He has nine national and international journal publications andhas presented his work at various conferences. He has research experience on water quality indicesand instrumentation for water characterization along with handling lab & field equipment for thesame. His research interests are focused on retrieval of water quality parameters from the satellite andsignificance of trace elements on metabolic disorders.

Dr Balivada’s contribution to the project is in terms of his expertise in understanding water parameters and analyzing the data obtained for relevant science research.

**Ritambhara Chauhan \| Technical Lead**  
Ritambhara Chauhan graduated in Computer Science and Engineering from IIT Hyderabad. During here association with Bank of America Continuum, Mumbai, she worked on Risk Management reports. She has served as a student counselor in IIT Hyderabad for 3 years. She specializes in writing problem-solving algorithms and using multiple technologies including C, C++, Python, R, Databases, etc. She takes interest in real world projects and is interested in using her technological and problem- solving skills in the social development sector. Ritambhara’s other skills include sketching, caricature art, sculpture making and singing. She is also an avid reader and a blogger.

She supports the project by looking at data curation and web development activities along with automation of operations for a seamless end user experience.

**Gopi Shaik \| Field Assistant**  
Gopi holds a MSc in Chemistry from Andhra University. With an understanding of various water parameters and experience with testing water quality, he is responsible for in-situ data collection and liaisoning with laboratories for sample analysis as required. He also calibrates various instruments and looks into maintenance issues from time to time.
