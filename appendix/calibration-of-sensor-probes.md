# Appendix VI: Calibration of Sensor Probes

Calibration is the process that standardizes the electrical or optical signals from the sensors to reagentstandards of known value. A major objective of calibration is to check the accuracy and efficiency of the instrument. In field research, the calibration of the instrument became more important as the system and surrounding change frequently, which may affect the precision of the instrument.To minimize the drift the instrument is calibrated against the references or known set of parameters.

The probes used in this study mostly have intuitive and menu driven calibration. HI 9829’s calibration routines are accessed by highlighting “Calibration” and pressing &lt;Select&gt; from the main menu shown in the meters. All calibration data is stored in the non-volatile probe memory, allowing probes to beconnected to different meters without recalibration. The user may also restore each parameter to afactory default calibration.

For calibration of HANNA probes we followed the steps and standard solutions provided in the user manual provided with the sensors $$^{22}$$ . We perform two types of calibration:

* Quick calibration is done every time on the site for parameters-pH, Dissolved Oxygen, Electrical Conductivity.
* Single parameter calibration which is done with the help of standard stock solutions provided by HANNA only as per the standard procedure stated in the user manual for the selected parameter probe.

**Frequency of calibration**

Generally, individual parameter calibration is done while fixing the new sensors in the probe structure.While, we perform individual calibration for pH, Electrical Conductivity, Nitrate at every 8-9 months interval, for DO is calibration is done every 2-3 months. As DO is more sensitive, so to maintain the accuracy we calibrate the probe every time we change the location.

**Quick calibration**

As the field probes are sensitive to surrounding system, environment, atmospheric conditions,pressure, humidity, etc. the quick calibration of the instrument is performed every time before boat ride. The instrument is calibrated for pH, Dissolved Oxygen, Electrical Conductivity using the standard quick calibration solution provided by the HANNA and following are the prescribed guidelines as given below:

Solution used: HI 9828-25 \(For both pH and electrical conductivity\)

* Fill the calibration beaker 2/3 full with HI 9828-25 calibration solution
* Slowly place the sensors into the solution and dislodge bubbles that may adhere to the sensors 
* Screw the calibration beaker completely on the probe body. \(Some solution may overflow\)
* Wait few minutes for the system to stabilize
* From the “Calibration” menu select “Quick calibration”
* A three item calibration menu will appear \(pH, Conductivity and Dissolved oxygen\) and “pH” will start to blink along with the “Not ready” message
* When the pH signal is stable, the “Ready” message appears. Press &lt;Confirm&gt; to store the calibrationdata.
* The “Storing” message will appear as the calibration proceeds to the next sensor. A checkmark will appear in the box next to “pH” to indicate Successful calibration
* Following the pH calibration, “Conductivity” will start to blink along with the “Not ready” message
* When the measurement is stable, “Ready” appears. Press &lt;Confirm&gt; to store the calibration dataand the “Storing” message will appear
* For DO calibration the message “Empty the beaker” will appear
* Unscrew the calibration beaker and empty the solution
* Shake any remaining liquid off the probe and beaker. \(Note: No droplets should remain on the DO sensor membrane\)
* Screw the empty calibration beaker on the probe body. The beaker should not be dry.
* Precaution: Do not attempt to dry/wipe the DO sensor as damage to the membrane may occur.
* Press &lt;Accept&gt; to close the displayed message.
* When the measurement is stable, “Ready” appears. Press &lt;Confirm&gt; to store the calibration data and the “Storing” message will appear. 
* Press &lt;OK&gt; to return to “Calibration” menu.

Quick Calibration is successfully done.

**Single parameter calibration - pH**

Preparation:

* From the “Calibration” menu select “Single param. calibration” and then “pH calibration”.
* The display shows two options: “Calibrate pH” and “Restore factory calib”.
* If a new pH sensor has been installed use “Restore factory calib.” \(Warning message from previous calibration\).
* If “Restore Factory calib” is selected, all user calibration data will be deleted and the factory default calibration is restored. A user calibration should follow immediately.
* If “Calibrate pH” is selected, the user can perform a new calibration using up to 3 buffers \(pH 4.01, 6.86, 7.01, 9.18, 10.01 or one custom buffer\).When a three point calibration is performed, all old data areoverwritten, while with a single or two-point calibration the meter will also use information from the previous calibration.

Precaution: To minimize cross contamination, use two beakers for each buffer solution: the first one for rinsing the sensor and the second one for calibration.

Procedure:

* The measured pH value is displayed, along with the temperature and the buffer value on the second level. If necessary, press the &lt;Cal point&gt; soft key and use the arrow keys to select the correct buffer.
* Immerse the pH sensor in the first buffer rinse solution and stir gently.
* Immerse the pH sensor and temperature probe into the selected buffer and stir gently. The temperature, pH buffer value and the “Not ready” message is displayed.
* Once the reading has stabilized the countdown timer will count down until the display shows the “Ready” message.
* Press &lt;Confirm&gt; to accept the calibration point.
* To avoid cross-contamination immerse the sensors in the next calibration buffer rinse solution andstir gently.

  •Press &lt;Cal Point&gt; to select the next buffer \(if necessary\), and repeat the calibration procedure outlined above with the second and third buffers. The message “Storing” followed by “Calibrationcompleted” will be displayed.

*  Press &lt;OK&gt; to return to the Calibration menu. Press &lt;Measure&gt; to return to the measurement screen.
