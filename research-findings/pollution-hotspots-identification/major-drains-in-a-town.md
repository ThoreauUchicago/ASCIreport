# Major Drains in a Town

A spike in EC values was observed at the meeting point of Ava drain with River Godavari in Rajahmundry. Sewage water from this drain is seen to be released into the river just ahead of the agriculture canal at Dowleswaram \(seefigure 19\). In Narsapur, most of the town’sdomestic waste reaches Godavari through channel 2 marked on the map. Channel 2 is connected to Muriki Kaluva drain which carries 40 percent of Narsapur’s waste water. CDOM heatmap shows an abrupt spike around this area due to the waste water mixing with riverwaters \(see figure 20\). From the heatmaps shownbelow, the transition from green to red zones around a major drain \(Ava drain in Rajahmundry and Channel 2 in Narsapur\) occurs in less than 50 m. This shows discharge of waste by these drains and its impact on Godavari.
