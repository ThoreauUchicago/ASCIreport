# Leaching Effects

The solid waste dumping site at Narsapur is on the river bank. A huge heap of waste is seen at this site. It is known to accumulate waste over the last few years. Leaching is the phenomenon by which harmful chemicals from landfills formedfrom dumping of waste dissolve and migrate into natural resources like river, groundwater, etc $$^{15}$$ A spike in EC observed at the solid waste dumping site in Narsapur indicates an occurrence of leaching which impacts the river water quality. Such chemical contamination has long-term harmful effects. Proper designing of the landfill site will prevent this.
