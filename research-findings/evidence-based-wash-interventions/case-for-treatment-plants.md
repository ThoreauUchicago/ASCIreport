# Case for Treatment Plants

The waste coming from the cities may contain a large amount of organic matter such as food, vegetables, human and animal excreta, paperfibers, plant material, and humus. This highamount of organic matter increases the biological and chemical oxygen demand of water, making its quality unsuitable for human and aquatic life.

The study’s findings indicate a need to establishsewage treatment plants in all three towns based on the high BOD and COD concentrations in the drains. A decentralized approach can be adopted since the total waste water generated in these towns is small. The following plots summarize BOD and COD levels in each drain for all three towns.

**Pollution load**  
To further assess if a treatment plant was required, total pollution load was calculated for each drain using channel flow data and BOD or COD concentrations. To illustrate, the following table estimates total BOD and COD load in kg per day for each drain in Narsapur on June 11, 2018 and July 18, 2018.

![Table 13: BOD and COD load per drain](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2853%29.png)

Based on the data, two findings emerge:

* Pollution load variation across drains and months is high.
* D7 \(the drain near slaughterhouse\) has high pollution load indicating a need for an effluent treatment plant at the slaughterhouse in addition to STP for the town.

**BOD/COD ratio**  
To validate the need for STP, waste water characteristics were analyzed by calculating theratio of BOD and COD. Low BOD/COD ratioi.e. &lt;0.2 indicates non-biodegradable waste. However the high ratio i.e. &gt;0.4 indicates that the waste is completely degradable. The values between 0.2-0.4 indicate that the waste is slowly degradable. Based on these values, the action required is listed below.

![Table 14: Waste type basis BOD/COD ratio](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%285%29.png)

In sector 1, BOD/COD ratio of most of the watersamples was found to be between 0.2 and 0.4 indicating that the waste is slowly degradable and its treatment might help in fast degradation. However, in March 2019, at drain D7 and in September 2018 at D8, the BOD/COD ratio wasfound to be &lt;0.2. This decline in the ratio suggests that at times the proportion of non-biodegradable waste is high in the drains and needs urgent treatment.

![Figure 36: Bar chart showing BOD/COD ratio for drains in sector 1 \(D1, D2, D3, D7 and D8 as described in figure 14\) on different days between June 11, 2018 and May 14, 2019 \(noted on X-axis\) in Narsapur](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2827%29.png)

All the samples collected from sector 2 have values ranging from 0.2 to 0.4 except one value in drain 15 that is &gt;0.8. This indicates the dominance of slow degradable waste in the drain.

![Figure 37: Bar chart showing BOD/COD ratio for drains in sector 2 \(D14 and D15 as described in figure 14\) on different days between June 11, 2018 and May 14, 2019 \(noted on X-axis\) in Narsapur](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2834%29.png)

Compared to sector 1 and sector 2, the dominance of non-biodegradable waste is found to be relatively high in sector 3. It is evident from thefigure that one sample in S1, two in S2, one in S3 and two in S4 have BOD/COD values &lt; 0.2.However, two samples in S1, one in S4 and two in S6 have ratios exceeding 0.4, while the ratios of rest of the samples lie between 0.2-0.4. This indicates mixed waste characteristics in the drains and requirement for waste water treatment before disposal. Sector 3 has some slum settlements which lack proper sanitation facilities. As a result, a high proportion of non-biodegradable wastemight be affecting this sector.

![Figure 38: Bar chart showing BOD/COD ratio for drains in sector 3 \(S1, S2, S3, S4 and S6 as described in figure 14\) on different days between June 11, 2018 and May 14, 2019 \(noted on X-axis\) in Narsapur](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2852%29.png)

Most of Narsapur’s waste characteristics indicate that BOD/COD is between 0.2 and 0.4 which implies that a treatment facility may not be urgent. However, for long-term safe sanitation planning, especially in the context of Narsapur being designed as a sanitation model town, a sewage treatment plant may be installed.
