# Locating Insanitary Toilets & Slum Zones

For town authorities to set up targeted interventions such as improvement in sanitationinfrastructure, they would benefit from knowingwhich parts of the town may have a concentration of insanitary toilets. Often, slum dwellers lack proper sanitation facilities and have no access to a toilet or do not use it. Data from drain monitoring correlated with insanitary toilets or slum zones inNarsapur, thus making this an effective method toidentify areas which require immediate attention from authorities. The following table shows CPCB limits for discharge into water bodies.

Fecal coliform \(FC\) in the waste water mainly results from human or animal excreta. However, the waste from paper and pulp mills, plantmaterials and agricultural runoff can alsoincrease fecal coliform concentration in waste water. High FC values observed in drains S3, S4, D3, D7 and D14 indicate high load of organic contamination. Refer to Narsapur Drainage System in Unit 3 to see the location of drains. From local authorities, it is known that ward 3 and ward 29 have the bigger slums in Narsapur and also a concentration of insanitary toilets. Drain S4 passes through ward 29 while drain D3 is close to ward 3.

High median FC values in drain D3, S3 and S4 could be because of slums which discharge sewage directly into the drains. In drain D7, the high fecal coliform concentration is due to the waste from the slaughterhouse that enters the drains D14 and D15, which in turn enter Pilla Kaluva. Pilla Kaluva also shows contamination which mayaffect health of villagers downstream since theyuse the canal water for drinking. This assessment indicates the need for town authorities to put in place necessary interventions to reduce such contamination.

Similarly in Palacole and Kovvur, the FC numbers are high, indicating human excreta or animal waste mixing directly into these storm water drains. In Kovvur, drain D1 has much higher median FC than other drains indicating  the presence of a potential insanitary toilet zone nearby.
