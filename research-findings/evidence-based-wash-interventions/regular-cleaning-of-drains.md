# Regular Cleaning of Drains

While setting up a treatment plant in Narsapur may take some time, waste water from households is discharged daily. Some drains were seen to be clogged with solid waste or with stagnant waters with algae and sludge in them. DO & turbidity sensors were installed by the project in two areas, one around Muriki Kaluva and another in drain D1 passing through the water treatment plant with the aim to understand if continuous monitoring can assess the need for regular cleaning of drains.

**Real-time DO**  
Dissolved oxygen concentration is regulated by the balance between atmospheric re-aeration, photosynthesis and respiration. The change in seasonal and diurnal DO concentration is often observed in the drains or water bodies. Generally, the DO concentration increases till afternoon due to increased rate of photosynthesis by aquatic plants. A fall in DO is observed in the night due to its consumption for respiration. However, in waste water drains, this trend depends on the mixing of waste water in the drain, level of organic load, BOD and COD. The graph below depicts the DO data \(in percentage\) between December 28, 2018 and January 10, 2019 from real-time sensors installed on the Muriki Kaluva drain.

The DO concentration of the drain at Muruki Kaluva peaks during afternoon. It starts increasing during 8 am and declines post afternoon. One probable reason is that water at Muriki Kaluva ismostly in the stationary state with minimum flowwhich restricts the mixing of atmospheric oxygen in the drain during lean discharge time. Algal growth has been observed in Murki Kalva drain. Due to photosynthesis by these algae and other phytoplankton in the drains, the DO concentration increases in the morning. However, the concentration decreases post afternoon because of the reduction in intensity of sunlight that limits the release of oxygen by algae or phytoplanktons. No such variation in DO was observed in drain D1 at the water treatment plant. This is because the water has a higherflow in that drain and no algae or phytoplanktongrowth was observed. The clear pattern of rise and fall in DO values in a day at Muruki Kaluva indicates high algae growth in it and requireregular cleaning and continuous flow. Stagnantdrain waters could also be breeding grounds for mosquitoes causing health hazards.
