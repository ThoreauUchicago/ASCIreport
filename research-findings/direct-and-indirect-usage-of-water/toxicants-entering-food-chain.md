# Toxicants Entering Food Chain

High concentration of some heavy metals may affect aquatic life and accumulate in them to enter the food chain. This might lead to another dimension of human health risk. River water is often used for irrigation activities and concentration of ions and heavy metals acts as source of nutrient for the crops. The concentration of heavy metals exceeding the permissible limits might also affect the growth and reduce fertility of the soil. In this study the Godavari river water quality is analyzed using the irrigation water quality provided by Central Water Commission \(CWC\) 2018 and the concentration of Cu and Zn was found above the standards at downstream in Narsapur. However, all the heavy metals were within the limits at Rajahmundry. High concentration of Cu in irrigation water may restrict the growth of the plants. High concentration of Zn is also toxic to crops at widely varying pH condition. The Zn toxicity was reduced with the increase in pH values.
