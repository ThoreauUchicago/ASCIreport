# Suitable for Bathing

The table below represents classification of water quality based on the water quality index as specified by CPCB. Class A water is safe for drinking while Class B is suitable for bathing.

An analysis of Water Quality Index \(WQI\) in Godavari at Rajahmundry-Kovvur stretch using the sensor data gathered from April 2017 to April 2019 from four locations with varying characteristics was carried out. 103 sensor- based water quality measurements are used to create WQI. pH, EC, DO and turbidity were used. The following equation was employed to calculate WQI as suggested by Wunderlin $$^{16}$$ .

The results show that most of the times water quality in Godavari at Rajahmundry-Kovvur stretch was found to be of medium to good quality, except in one instance. This implies suitability for Class B-bathing water standards. The following figure depicts the graphical representation of the results.
