# Nature’s Attempt at Revival

Seasonal variations in multiple parameters show trends where pollution levels in monsoons are reduced as compared to summers. This is mainly due to higher quantum of freshwater in the river due to rains or opening of barrage gates releasing water from upstream. While the pollution load in the river from these towns remains similar across seasons, the dilution due to increased fresh water improves the water quality. This is nature’s way of reviving the river basin ecosystem annually.

**Electrical Conductivity reduces in monsoons in Narsapur but remains the same in the Rajahmundry-Kovvur stretch of River Godavari**  
Most days of the year, the conductivity values are extraordinarily high in Godavari in Narsapur becauseof sea water influence except during some days in the monsoon. Low EC values in monsoons indicate the opening of fresh water barrage during August/September and high runoff from the adjoining catchment areas. Pin-pointing sources of pollution is more effective in the monsoon season whenoverall EC values are low \(e.g. leachates from solid waste collection site leaking into Godavari\). See picture titled monsoon 2017.

**Chlorophyll level rise in summers**  
Chlorophyll provides green color to plants. High chlorophyll in river or surface water bodies indicates high algae. These algae serve as the primary producer and play an important role in the food chain. However, excess concentration can cause algal bloom and eutrophication. High chlorophyll level also indicates excess of nutrient in the aquatic system. Generally, chlorophyll concentration increases during the summer because of relatively less flow rate, high intensity of sunlight and availability of nutrients. Chlorophyll levels were observed to rise in the summers at Narsapur stretch of River Godavari.
