# Fish Kills-Inverse Relation between EC & DO

Based on the sensors reading at Narsapur and Kovvur - Rajahmundry stretch of River Godavari, is negatively correlated with the dissolved oxygenconcentration. It is evident from the figure thatthe water with high EC has relatively low DO and when we plot all measured values of DO against EC it shows a negative trend line. High concentration of EC in water indicates highconcentration of dissolved salt/ions. However, DO concentration in water is affected by several factors including atmospheric mixing/pressure, temperature, salinity and growth, and photosynthesis of phytoplankton in the water bodies. The solubility of gases in water decreases by the addition of salts, resulting in a decreasein DO. This relation has a seasonal effect due tomonsoons but increase in EC due to domestic discharge or salts from industrial waste can lead to a decrease in DO. Aquatic life needs DO&gt; 5mg/l for survival. Fish kill events have been recorded when DO levels fall below 3mg/l.
