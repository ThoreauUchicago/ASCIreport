# Executive Summary

Declining water quality has become a global concern as human populations grow, industrial and agricultural activities expand, and climate change threatens to cause major alterations to the hydrological cycle. Seventy percent of surfacewater in India is not fit for consumption . A pressing need has emerged for comprehensive and accurate assessments of trends in water quality in order to provide a basis for action at all levels.

Effective river basin management and water policy formulation requires access to reliable and up-to-date data in easy-to-understand formats for timely decision making. Traditional laboratory-based testing is tedious, slow and expensive. It is also prone to inaccuracies in results due to error in sample collection, transportation or testing. By relying on a handful of data points from such sampling limits one’s capacity to Analyze or generate insights. In contrast, spatial monitoring of river water quality at high resolution can identify pollution hotspots and provide data for putting in place relevant Water, Sanitation and Health \(WASH\) interventions. Automated, real-time sensors can facilitate measurements at this scale by providing quick results while being less prone to human errors. The incremental cost of data collection using such sensors \(onceprocured\) is low. Monitoring river stretches multiple times a month at differenttimes of the day help understand pollution spread and identify trends in water quality over time.

Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering \(PME\) at University of Chicago developed the Water-to-Cloud \(W2C\) system for such high resolution spatial and temporal monitoring to gain insights that traditional approach may not capture. State-of-the-art sensors with a geospatial tag and time stamp are taken around a river on a boat to collect hundreds of data points in a few hours. Various physical \(pH, electrical conductivity, turbidity\), chemical \(dissolved oxygen, nitrate\) and bio-chemical \(tryptophan, chlorophyll\) parameters are measured several times a month in an automated manner. In drains, these sensors are taken around manually. Synthesizing this data as color-coded heatmaps by superimposing it on geospatial maps helps in pinpointing contaminant sources, analyzing spread of pollution over time and area as well as identifying trends.

W2C supported the Andhra Pradesh government in developing Narsapur, Palacole and Kovvur as model sanitation towns by evolving the Water-to- Cloud approach and monitoring Godavari waters at two sites, Kovvur-Rajahmundry and Narsapur between October 2016 and June 2019. Based on 197,037 data points gathered via 161 boat-based experiments, Godavari water seems safe for bathing \(Water Quality Index shows suitability for class B usage$$^3$$ \). However, water from these 11 sq.km. and 3.2 sq.km. stretches respectively was not always suitable for direct consumption due to fecal contamination \(upto 330CFU/100ml\). Heavy metals were found in water which could have led to toxicants entering the food chain via irrigated crops or fish. We also showed how this mapping technique can be used effectively to pinpoint point sources ofpollution such as drains and industrial outlets with high spatial precision \(&lt;50mrange\). W2C system also identified slow leaching effects in Narsapur due tonon-point sources such as a solid waste dumping site which would otherwise be missed out. Through our studies, we also showed, through a two-monthexperiment, how stationary sensors can be installed at specific locations such asdrains and provide continuous real-time data in a robust, unattended fashion. This can be adapted as a means for ensuring regulatory compliance in secure fashion without the need for human inspection or middlemen.

Studying 25 waste water drains in Narsapur, Kovvur and Palacole through 895 sensor-based measurements and 261 lab-based measurements, we located insanitary toilet zones and slum areas with inadequate sanitation facilities for authorities to set up interventions. Since all waste water in these towns is discharged into Godavari or nearby canals without treatment, regular cleaning of drains carrying it is recommended to avoid clogging and algal growth whichmay reduce dissolved oxygen levels thereby affecting aquatic life negatively. Aneed for setting up decentralized sewage treatment plants \(STPs\) for long-term safe sanitation planning for such towns was also recognized.

We provided digital access to all our data and visualizations through an openaccess platform \(http://thoreau.uchicago.edu/water/home\). This includes the 1,97,932 sensor data points for pH, dissolved oxygen \(DO\), electrical conductivity \(EC\), turbidity, colored dissolved organic matter \(CDOM\), tryptophan, etc. as well as 480 lab tested samples for bio-chemical oxygen demand \(BOD\), chemical oxygen demand \(COD\), fecal coliform. It ensured accountability and transparency while building trust on our approach. Stakeholders includingresearchers, practitioners, sanitation inspectors, government officers, mediaand communities could assess the impact of their own actions on changing water quality and use the latest data in any decision making through this portal. We explored machine learning-based water quality prediction models to reduce reliance on laboratory-based testing.

Non-stationary sensor-based monitoring was thus found to complement and strengthen government’s established system of laboratory-based monitoring to make it more effective in the near future. An urgent need for a universally acceptable protocol for sensor-based monitoring was felt. Availability of trained operators, ensuring accurate calibration and maintenance procedures for sensors and upgrading to unmanned vehicles would facilitate faster adoption of this approach at scale. Water-to-Cloud has, in essence, showcased its potential to fill the gaps in the current system, act as a decision making tool for policymakers, invoke public participation in regulation of river water quality and democratize access to river water quality data in the long run.
