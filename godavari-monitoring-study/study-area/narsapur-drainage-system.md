# Narsapur drainage system

Narsapur was the first town selected formonitoring of the drain water quality. This monitoring took place between May 2018 and June 2019 on a weekly basis. The major drainsin the city with minimum flow greater than0.01MLD were selected for monitoring. Thirteen major drains with a cumulative waste water load of over 9 MLDs contributed by nearly 60,000residents were identified. Cumulatively, theycarry over 90 percent of waste water generated in Narsapur each day. To understand the drainage system in the city, it has been divided into three major sectors based on the collective outfall points of the drains.

**Sector 1: River Godavari**  
In sector 1, there are approximately 25,000 residents who discharge their waste water intoRiver Godavari. Out of these 10 drains, five majordrains i.e. D1, D2, D3, D7 and D8 with a total ****discharge around 4.74MLD have been identified for monitoring. These drains discharge directly into River Godavari.

**Sector 2: Pilla Kaluva:**  
Pilla Kaulva is a freshwater canal that is a drinking water source for residents living downstream from Narsapur. However, a population of around3000 living in five wards discharges waste waterinto this canal directly. There are around 15 small drain outlets which empty into Pilla Kaulva at various locations. The study is monitoring two major drains-D14 and D15-which contribute around 0.22 MLD of waste water, which might cause health issues to people who consume the canalâ€™s water for various purposes.

**Sector 3: Muriki Kaluva**  
Muriki Kaluva is a drain that flows into the townfrom north-west. About 4.22 MLD of waste water is discharged in to Muriki Kaluva by a populationof approximately 29000 through the five majordrain outlets-S1, S2, S3, S4 and S6 that havebeen identified for monitoring. It also carries waste water from other towns both from the western and northern parts of the west Godavari districts. All of the waste water in Muriki Kaluva is discharged into River Godavari via the canal at the sand ramp area. This canal meets Godavari in the upstream part of the town.
