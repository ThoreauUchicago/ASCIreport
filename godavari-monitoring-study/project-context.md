# Project Context

Government of Andhra Pradesh \(GoAP\) launched Swachh Andhra Mission with a goal of achieving total sanitation in line with the vision of Swachha Bharat Mission \(Urban\). Sampoorna Swachhta Sankalp \(S3\) is an initiative of the Administrative Staff College of India \(ASCI\), Ernst & Young \(E&Y\) and the International Innovation Corps \(IIC\) to design, implement, and monitor improved decentralized sanitation systems in Andhra Pradesh to support this vision. Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering \(PME\) at University of Chicago was sub-contracted to ASCI through Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to study the impact of waste water on River Godavari and monitor waste water quality of drains in riverfront towns of Narsapur, Palacole, and Kovvur under S3. These towns in the west Godavari district were suggested by the Municipal Administration and Urban Development Department \(MA&UD\) for transformation into model towns in terms of sanitation facility.

Water-to-Cloud system, developed by PME, would help understand how riverfront towns impacted water pollution, and also the impact of S3â€™s septage management interventions across the three towns. Time varying sources of pollution such as malfunctioning sewage treatment plants could also be pinpointed through this technique. The project thus aimed at demonstrating that scalable water quality mapping systems can detect and predict water contamination.
