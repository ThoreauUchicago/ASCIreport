# Phase I: Scoping Study \(October 2016 to March 2017\)

**Project planning**  
The project started with the aim to develop a cloud enabled water quality sensing network in the Godavari river to explore sensing techniques for rapid measurements that are indicative of anthropogenic contaminants in the water such as those related to human, agricultural and industrial waste. This would help understand how riverfront towns contributed to water pollution, and also understand the impact of BMGF funded septage management interventions led by ASCI across the three towns - Narsapur, Kovvur and Palacole.

**Sensor research**  
Various water quality monitoring parameterswere identified for sensor-based monitoringin real time: pH, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, electrical conductivity, nitrate, ammonia,chlorophyll, tryptophan fluorescence, etc. A market research study was carried out to find off-the-shelf commercial sensors to measure these parameters. A multi-parameter sensor from Hanna Instruments, HI 9829, was identified to be the most suitable for selected physio-chemical parameters. The fluorescence or biochemical parameters were added later.

**Getting started**  
A field team was set up and requisite permissionswere sought from local authorities in Kovvur to carry out the monitoring. Reconnaissance visits were made to Kovvur and Rajahmundry to map points where waste water from these towns entered Godavari. After studying entry points of drains, industrial sites such as International Paper APPM Ltd. in Rajahmundry, the discharge point of the drains leaving the sewage treatment plant, etc., a tentative route map was created for boat ride experiments.
