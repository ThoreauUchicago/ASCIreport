# Phase II: Piloting Water-to-Cloud System \(April 2017 to September 2017\)

**Pilot study**  
A team comprising a water chemist and a sensor engineer began working on the project full-time. Upon procurement of the sensors, lab calibrationand on-field calibrations were carried out. A suitable boat and boat-person were identified.This technique was then deployed on Godavari inRajahmundry. Initial troubleshooting helped fine tune the methodology in terms of how the sensorsshould be attached to the boat, fixing them toavoid incorrect values, holding them tight at a particular depth, etc.

**Sensor validation**  
To ensure the accuracy of sensor-based measurements, calibration protocols were followed \(see appendix\). Additionally, an independent, government-recognized laboratory was appointed to validate the results. Vimta Labs was chosen after evaluating a number of options Along with regular boat sorties, samples from the field were sent to the lab and all the parameter readings were verified to match with sensor readings. In addition, ex-situ parameters such as BOD, COD, total coliform, fecal coliform, etc. were measured by sending water samples to the lab.

**Replication to Narsapur**  
After a successful pilot at Rajahmundry-Kovvur stretch of River Godavari, operations were expanded to Narsapur to monitor the waste water leaving the town into Godavari. A similar boat ride technique was deployed to study spread of pollution. Domestic discharges and agricultural run offs were identified as main sources of waste water. There are no major industries in Narsapur. The water quality data was influenced by backwaters from the Bay of Bengal.
