# Phase V: Scaling Up, 24x7 Monitoring \(October 2018 to March 2019\)

**Operationalizing real-time stationary sensors**  
Real-time DO and Turbidity sensors from Optex, a Japanese company, have been installed at two critical drain locations in Narsapur to measure water quality every 5 minutes. The Optex sensors are tuned to display data in real time but do not transmit it to a cloud storage network. To make wireless transmission possible, the W2C team has worked with Advance Tech Pvt. Ltd. to developa data logger to store values in a flash driveand transmit data to a cloud server using GSM technology. Two sensors have been installed in Narsapur-one on the drain, D1 passing through the Water Works department and the other in Muriki Kaluva, a major drain passing through the slum area. These locations were strategically chosen because together they carry nearly 40% of the townâ€™s waste to Godavari. This helped understand the pollution trend of drains throughout the day. An online dashboard was developed to visualize data generated from the stationary real-time sensors. The dashboard depicts temperature, turbidity and dissolved oxygen level in graphical and tabular formats. This can be accessed any time to check live status of water quality and understand daily, monthly or seasonal trends.

**Scaling up to Palacole and Kovvur**  
Based on the success of drain water monitoring study in Narsapur, ASCI requested the W2C team to expand operations to Kovur and Palacole.Major drains were identified in both towns withthe support of S3 team. The drain monitoring protocol was replicated at the new sites to collect regular data on drain water quality in these towns. Regular operations for drain monitoring have continued since then in all three towns.

**Identification of Effluent Treatment Plant \(ETP\) site in Narsapur**  
Drain pollution data was analyzed to assess theneed for an Effluent Treatment Plant \(ETP\) inNarsapur. Each drain was studied based on its pollution level and load. Drain D7, connectedto the local slaughterhouse, was identified as a potential site based on high pollution load in the drain. The analysis was presented to ASCI to support their idea of setting up an ETP in concurrence with the local authorities.
