# Phase III: Data Curation and On-ground Implementation \(October 2017 to March 2018\)

**Web platform for digital curation**  
While collecting credible data is important, disseminating it in easy-to-understand formats is crucial too. Decision makers may not understand technical data presented in tabular formats. However, giving a color code to each numerical value and creating data visualizations in the form of heatmaps by superimposing the geo-tagged water quality data makes interpretation easier. In order to democratize data access on pollution spread in the river, a full-time web developer was engaged to create a website \([http://thoreau.uchicago.edu/water/home](http://thoreau.uchicago.edu/water/home)\) to curate heat maps generated after each boat ride. This website presents interactive data visualizations allowing users the choice of site, date and parameter to analyze pollution spread in river through heatmaps.

**Drain monitoring in Narsapur**  
A need was felt to move from monitoring River Godavari to monitoring the drains that are responsible for the waste water entering theriver. Narsapur was identified as one of BMGF’s10 model sanitation towns globally. It is located at the banks of River Godavari, 20 km before the river enters Bay of Bengal. Concentratedefforts were made to monitor waste water indrains and canals of Narsapur before the waste water reaches the river. ASCI and W2C started with monitoring drain water in Narsapur and prepared a detailed drain map. With the support of local authorities, major drains were identified based on the amount of waste load being carried in each drain. A baseline study was conducted to evaluate water quality of Narsapur’s drains under the guidance of former Senior Advisor to Andhra Pradesh Pollution Control Board, who was hired as a consultant on this project. The results were discussed with experts at ASCI to plan for regular monitoring.

**Additional sensor procurement**  
While the Hanna HI-9829 sensor platform monitors physico-chemical parameters, a turnersC3 fluorometer sensor platform has been procured to measure chlorophyll, CDOM fluorescence and tryptophan fluorescence. These provide anindication of the organic content in any water body. For example, tryptophan is an amino acid present in pathogens. Higher the tryptophan in water, higher the organic content, which would mean potentially higher BOD values. This is a relatively new approach but shows the promise of reducing BOD test time from a few days in lab to instantaneously in the field. In addition, during review meetings with various stakeholders, a need was felt to monitor the quantity along with the quality of waste water generated. A flow probe FP211 was thus purchased to measure the pollution load.
