# Phase VI: Wrapping up \(April 2019 to September 2019\)

**Dashboard for drains**  
A drains dashboard was created for Narsapur to depict all the waste water quality parameters measured in the last couple of years. This is independent of the heatmaps from the boat sorties that are already curated on a regular basis. This dashboard enables comparison between differentdrains on various parameters to understand the pollution loading patterns in the town and help identify drains connected to insanitary toilets or poor sanitation facilities. A slider allows the user to move between various dates of data collection to observe temporal trends in waste water quality for each drain. The dashboard can be accessed at the Thoreau website.

**Operationalizing UV-based BOD sensor**  
Real-time BOD and COD sensor has been procured from Photonic Measurements, a UK based company. It has been operationalized to measure real-time values of BOD, COD and TOC in rivers and drains. This sensor isdipped at identified locations on the drains toget real-time values. An orientation session was conducted by the sensor designer to train the team on calibration, handling and maintenance of the sensor. The sensor values were validated by independent laboratories. The readings were found to be highly unreliable based on limited data obtained so far and the sensors have now been sent back to the manufacturer for repair.

**Wrapping up**  
For a smooth handover to ASCI, all data from various sensor and lab-based measurements in the river, drains and canals have been compiled to be handed over to ASCI. The data also remains available on the Thoreau web platform in raw form as well as in the form of heatmaps andsummary statistics. The field team from S3 will be briefed about the operations and a knowledge transfer session can be held for the capacity building of local teams upon ASCIâ€™s request. The tech platform built can be made available to the town for future data visualization needs for water pollution data upon a written request made to W2C by the town authorities.
