# Phase IV: Data Analysis \(April 2018 to September 2018\)

**Using machine learning to establish correlations**  
The team explored machine learning models to establish correlation between ex-situ parameters such as BOD and COD with in-situ parameters such as pH, EC, DO and turbidity. Various techniques and models were used to establish these correlations such as Simple Linear Regression, Multiple Linear Regression, Supportvector machine \(SVM\), Adaboost and ArtificialNeural Network \(ANN\). The results of using machine learning are discussed in later sections.

**Exploring real-time 24x7 monitoring options for physical/organic parameters**  
Along with collecting sensor-based data from the River Godavari and regular monitoring of over 13 drains in Narsapur, the project has also been monitoring DO and turbidity at two critical sites all through the day. The idea was to monitor diurnal variations in parameters in peak and lean hours of the day. To comprehensively study the quality of waste water leaving Narsapur, we explored 24x7 real-time monitoring stationary sensors that can measure various physical, physico-chemical and organic parameters such as DO, turbidity, BOD and COD. Various national and international vendors were contacted to assess suitable options. DO and turbidity sensors were procured from a Japan-based company, Optex. BOD and COD are parameters that are measured in the laboratory with no real- time sensors available in the market yet. BODtakes upto five days to be measured in the lab. Surrogate parameters such as fluorescence andultraviolet \(UV\) absorbance were explored. Multiple consultations were held with vendors, their customers and experts from ASCI followingwhichaUK-basedvendorwasfinalizedtomeasureBOD in real time based on UV absorbance at 254 nm which captures the signature for organic content. An understanding of organic contentat different locations on the drain could help inidentifying proximity to insanitary toilets.

**Pollution load and data analysis**  
Analysis of water quality data has been discussed in detail in Unit 5 and 6. Several experiments were conducted to understand the pollution load in terms of kilograms of COD and BOD contributed by each drain per day. Width and depth of eachdrain were measured. Using a flowmeter, the flowin each drain was measured at a 2-hour intervalacross the day to come up with the average flow rate for it. The drain dimensions and flow wereused to calculate the total waste water leaving Narsapur, which is estimated to be ~9 MLD. The volume of waste water in each drain was multiplied with BOD and COD data to calculate the BOD and COD pollution load of each drain. The F.Coli levels helped pinpoint the hotspots of insanitary waste along the drains for ASCI to identify relevant interventions. The seasonal trends of various water quality parameters wereidentified. Water quality profile of each drainwas analyzed and compared to draw insights on required interventions. The W2C team also provided the waste water quality data to support ASCI assess the need for setting up treatment plant in Narsapur.
